== Description ==

<a href="http://ReviewEmbed.com" target="_blank">ReviewEmbed</a> enables online businesses to make the most out of their reviews by displaying widgets containing Facebook, Google and Yelp reviews in pursuit of greater conversion.

The ReviewEmbed plugin simplifies the process of adding widgets to a Wordpress site by removing the necessity for a shortcode creator, as well as unifying the list and access of review widgets directly within the Wordpress admin. The plugin makes calls to the <a href="http://ReviewEmbed.com" target="_blank">ReviewEmbed</a> server to synchronize widget information and present it inside of Wordpress.

<a href="http://ReviewEmbed.com" target="_blank">ReviewEmbed</a> requires an active account and paid subscription to launch and operate live widgets.
